This is eventually going to be a simple cms that uses HTML templates 
and some setup scripts to automatically generate the proper mysql tables 
and php code to display and edit a website.

TODO:
1. fix boogs!!

Already completed:
1. integrate WysiHat into a page so that any div with class="editor" can be edited
   and sent to the server to be processed (example - editor.php)
2. create server side code that saves POSTed div contents to the database
   (crudely done at this point - proof of concept)
3. create server side code that reads an HTML template that automatically generates mysql tables
4. create server side code that auto-generate php files that allow viewing and editing of the site

Goals:
1. Add features:
   -cms editor history
   -edit in html mode
   -log in to edit
