This is eventually going to be a simple cms that uses HTML templates 
and some setup scripts to automatically generate the proper mysql tables 
and php code to display and edit a website.

Already completed:
1. integrate WysiHat into a page so that any div with class="editor" can be edited
   and sent to the server to be processed (example - editor.php)

Goals:
1. create server side code that saves POSTed div contents to the database
2. create server side code that reads an HTML template that automatically generates mysql tables
3. create server side code that auto-generate php files that allow viewing and editing of the site
