This is a CMS that aims to make it easy to set up content management for relatively simple websites created in HTML

Here is how it works:
1. Create your html website
2. Add comment tags around div's you want a user to be able to edit
   <!--START EDITABLE REGION-->
   <div>editable content</div>
   <!--END EDITABLE REGION-->
3. Place entire website (HTML, images, js, etc) in the templates directory
4. Add proper info to php/sqlStrings.php and setup/settings.php
5. Go to setup/setup.php in your web browser
6. All divs marked as editable will now be in a mysql database and php will be generated which allows the content to be viewed and edited
7. Generated php will be located in the website root as specified in setup/settings.php
